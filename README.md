# UJIndoorLoc_cleaning
This code is for cleaning the invalid examples and replicas in the training data provided for fingerprinting-based indoor positioning by [UJIIndoorLoc](http://indoorlocplatform.uji.es/databases/get/1/). We use the cleaned code in the paper [*CDM: Compound dissimilarity measure and an application to fingerprinting-based positioning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06208) published in [IPIN 2018](http://ipin2018.ifsttar.fr/awards/best-student-paper/).

The code is available in Python. The cleaned data can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lcccr5s3W-PsXKbLxD2WCjmzbmFqMtSq?usp=sharing).
